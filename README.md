# Hanabi-Plus
A peer-to-peer recreation of the original card game "Hanabi" for Android devices.
This app uses P2P connections so that people can find players for the game without going out of the way to establish servers. The title screen allows for a small start and host/join button. Connections between players are still being determined before full writing of the game file.
